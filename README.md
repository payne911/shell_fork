# shell_fork
"Shell", coded in C, that can execute a few basic commands using fork().

# Cloning the project

1. Clone the project in the folder of your choice: `git clone https://github.com/payne911/shell_fork.git`
2. Then open `CLion`, and select "`New project...`".
3. Select "`C Executable`", and the `Location` as the folder that was just cloned. The `Language standard` should be `C99`.
4. Agree with the new project using the files already in the folder as the source.
5. The `Missing CMake file` warning message at the top should be taken care of: select the blue link at the top right and select the `CMakeLists.txt` of the cloned project.
6. You're done! :)
